        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>
          I am a tech enthusiast, entrepreneur, and self-motivated leader with a passion for teamwork and innovation.
          As an IT student, I also thrive as an entrepreneur, constantly seeking new ways to generate income. My commitment
          to leadership extends beyond the classroom; I serve as the Secretary of CUZITA, an organization for Cavendish IT
          students founded by Samuel Kapasa, and as the Prime Minister of the Meheba Former Leaders Association, established
          by Fiston Mwamba.
        </p>
        <p>
          My extensive involvement in various leadership roles includes serving as Class Representative, Business Club Secretary,
          School Headboy, JETS Treasurer, Mathematics Club President, and Deputy Treasurer of the Scripture Union. Additionally,
          I was the Secretary of the History Club, demonstrating a broad range of leadership experience both in school and the community.
